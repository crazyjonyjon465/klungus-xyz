          I figured, with the more books that I read and finish, I may as well document and review them. I figure first will be what I finished most recently, which was <i>This Is How You Lose the Time War</i> by Amal-El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone.

              <i>This Is How You Lose the Time War</i> is probably the most modern book I've ever read. I have a lot of catching up to do, so reading up on a book from 2019 is not a very usual occurrence for me. However, other circumstances brought the book to my attention.<br>
              When a fan account for the manga <i>Trigun</i> under the name "Bigolas Dickolas" <a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war-trigun-twitter-amazon-1850424312">made a bizarrely viral reccomendation of the book on Twitter</a>, the book made it to the Amazon bestsellers list within about a week. Given the excitement around it, I figured it was worth a shot.<br>
              <br>
              And it was!
              <br><br>
              <i>How You Lose the Time War</i> is one of the most convenient books I've read in a long time. The book is formatted as a series of letters between two amorphous futuristic cyborg-ladies(?) on opposite sides of a war through time, each with a few pages of description giving exposition and interesting character moments. This makes it very easily read for brief periods of time; pick up the book, get through a single letter, and inevitably get distracted. Also, if that synopsis feels like it was a lot all at once, that's because it kind of is. The opening sections do as best as they can to get the sci-fi concept across, but there is a fair amount of Rolling With It that's necessary to get into this book.<br>
              If you accomplish this, though, you'll find some absolutely beautifully written literature on the other side of it. I can't exactly describe too much without getting into spoilers, but the outline of the story feels vintage in a very fundmental way. Similar to when I came out of the theater after watching <i>The Northman</i>, I finished this book with a mild urge to go read some Shakespeare just to get more of what I just read. The prose is funny and rewards attentive reading, with lots of concepts and metaphors reoccurring for beautiful effect later on. If you're okay with a little high-concept high drama, I would absolutely reccomend this book.
