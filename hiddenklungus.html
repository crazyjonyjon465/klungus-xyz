      Well, not too much has really happened since the last time I saw this<br>
      I have a lot more song ideas than I did before and I got some new audio equipment to make them happen, so hopefully that starts resulting in some actual finished products<br>
      Going to be trying to make this website look... just a bit more polished, hopefully. Working without any experience and just referencing off of sites I find that look cool, so hopefully that goes okay<br>

      Work was definitely something - finished everything I had to do by 12:30 and barely anything new came in before I was out at 5<br>
      Finally hit 1000 ELO and terrified to ever play again for fear of it going under again<br>
      Probably going to see the new Avatar film (and hopefully The Whale) soon

      Slept in well this morning - still haven't made my bed as of 10:51pm<br>
      Looking to do a little more with this website, possibly turn it into a blog sort of deal like it was 2005 or smthn<br>
      Had a very important (I think) interview for college, so fairly excited with that, though not sure if I should be looking into scholarships at this point<br>
      Big into chess since I last updated this site, been winning a lot of games recently, <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/crazyjonyjon465" target="_blank">almost to 1000 ELO on chess.com</a>, which I'm quite proud of<br>
      Completely taken me out of video games in general though, it's a little bit all-consuming but generally worth it<br>
      So, I think that's it... stay tuned, if you're out there, I guess
