        THE ALBUM IS DONE! I ended up finding a distributor that seems to work for everything I'm looking to do, and Event Horizon <i>should</i> be streaming on pretty much all platforms on August 21st! I'm very excited to get this project out of my head and into places where people can actually hear it. In other news, my headphones have broken again, but in a kind of convenient way - the warranty on this model is a whole year, and I have yet to have a pair last for more than 5 months, so every time they break I get a new pair for free. Hypothetically, if this continues, I should get free headphones for the rest of my life (or JBL can simply make headphones that are more durable).

          I've been thoroughly enjoying <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylegordonisgreat/video/7260884267255794990">this Eurodance parody</a> that went extremely viral on Twitter for some reason, with a full version coming out on August 22nd, which I will be waiting very patiently for.
        </li>
        <li>
          Another great video to come out recently was <a href="https://youtu.be/5u7euN1HTuU">this incredible documentary</a> about the Kennedy assassination that goes into incredible detail about the events that took place inside the building from where the shots were fired.

        <li>
          Tom Scott's video about how <a href="https://youtu.be/xq4ZkfojSis">a bear accidentally created public domain footage with his camera</a> was awesome to see, especially since the footage is <a href="https://archive.org/details/grizzly-bear-selfie/GX010742.MP4">all free to download</a> on the Internet Archive.

          In terms of music, there's been a few songs running through my head constantly, namely <a href="https://youtu.be/_NywTcGOUkE">Life During Wartime by the Talking Heads</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/88Di1EWSU0U">Call On Me by Eric Prydz</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/I_g7KhrXGdA">Love Brand New by Bob Moses</a>.

        Excitement is very present this week - college getting closer and a little more "real" each day. In less complicated news, I'm rapidly approaching completion of the album I'm gearing up to put out. Looking for the right distributor has been by far the hardest part, but I think I'm beginning to approach an answer (and a release). The music is <i>at least</i> 99% finished (probably more), so the rest of the material has to be figured out - including a name for the project as a whole. It's strange how hard this part of it is, but I guess it has to get done eventually.

          One of my favorite things to find lately was <a href="https://youtu.be/Zd_UcjMusUA">this video</a> of a funk/fusion drummer listening to "Enter Sandman" for the first time and completely nailing the whole song the next time through. Learning an entire song this quickly is almost incomprehensible to me, especially without any written notes or anything, but this guy makes it look so easily. Very entertaining to hear the reaction of everyone in the room at the end.
        </li>
        <li>
          I've also become a bit obsessed with <a href="https://youtu.be/SMhwddNQSWQ">that time Weird Al made a DEVO pastiche that absolutely stacks up to their best work.</a> One of the members of DEVO would later say on the song, "I was in shock. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard. He sort of re-sculpted that song into something else and... I hate him for it, basically." Absolutely deserved.
        </li>
        <li>
          In terms of new music, I've found two really different kinds of covers - one <a href="https://youtu.be/C2lrap_qGsU">a hardcore cover of some "Iraq Lobster" bit from Family Guy</a> by someone on Youtube called FoxWithGuns and the other <a href="https://youtu.be/gQmeziQK0Hc">a glittery cover of "Shake It" by Metro Station</a> by an artist called Bad Heather.

        I've only got so long of free time today (in a good way), so this one will probably be brief. I've still been super happy creativity-wise these last few weeks, with one or two more songs pretty much wrapped up since the last blog post. I've also got yet another project that I've hopped on that seems to be mostly under wraps as of now, so I'll keep quiet here about it.<br>
        Recently, I changed my name on Bandcamp from KLNGS to Telstarred. This was partially because KLNGS is a bit hard to remember, doesn't carry very much meaning, and is horrible to search up given that search engines think you were trying to spell "Kings". So, I changed it to Telstarred. Why that?<br>
        Well, I quite like the various references it has. Telstar was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstar_1">a satellite from the early 60's</a> as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstar_(instrumental)">an instrumental surf song by the Tornadoes</a> that I have good memories of. Given that my sound is quite inspired by the 80s, it may seem odd to pull in a much older reference, but I quite like connecting these two eras in this way.<br>
        One thing that synthwave and other 80s nostalgia can do is gloss over many of the complicated parts of the era it looks back on, which is a lot easier to do for the 80s than the decades that came before. I think by bringing this older reference in, it comments on the ever-present nature of history - after all, the original satellite is defunct, but it still orbits the earth to this day.

          I've fallen in love with the song <a href="https://youtu.be/NiblaBqJjIg">"We Don't Deserve Love"</a> by Arcade Fire recently. I recommend the whole album, but if you have to listen to one song from it, choose this.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next thing I found on the internet was something called <a href="https://feverdreampainting.bandcamp.com/album/schizoweb"><i>schizoweb</i></a> by Feverdream Painting. This album got thrown to me by the YouTube reccomendation algorithm, and giving it a listen was certainly interesting. It's a lot more intense than what I like to make, but there's no reason not to give different things a listen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lastly, I found this website called <a href="https://radio.garden">Radio Garden</a>, which lets you listen in on radio stations from all around the world. It's great for my focus to find some foreign house station and just listen along.

        The last few weeks have been extremely creative! I've been experimenting with perfecting the sound of a lot of genres I mess around with - instead of making synthwave-esque things, for example, I've looked into how to properly recreate the 80's sound and made some pretty cool tracks with that idea. Also, I've been playing around with using my actual voice, which has been surprisingly easier to integrate into my music than I figured it would be. Since I've got so much music put together that I haven't posted, I figured it's about high time I wait just a little longer and put these together into an actual album (tentative name is DIEGESIS, but that's still up in the air). Right now, lyrics are sparse, but I've generally enjoyed playing around with the concept of human relationships being existential in nature, like how you see in <a href="https://youtu.be/rsF5EWOQN9Y">Kiss Me (Kill Me)</a> by JerryTerry or more earnestly in <i>This Is How You Lose the Time War</i> by Amal-El Mohtar and Max Gladstone. A good mixture between eldritch horror and standard pop romance seems to keep things grounded enough to not sound out of place while still keeping those fun themes.

          I figure now is the part of the blog post where I show off some things I found on the internet.
      </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              First, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2cJKGXHNKM&t=967s">an awesome tutorial on the 80s sound</a> by Eliana D'Angelo - the tips on layering the drums helped out a ton with one of the tracks I made recently. The video goes into choosing samples, tips on getting groove, and some music psychology.
            </li>
            <li>
              This one is similar, but with a lot more specific of a use case; <a href="https://youtu.be/cSBC3wi0J7o">a tutorial on getting an 80s synth bass sound</a>. Even those this tutorial uses Serum, I was able to port it all into my beloved free wavetable synth, <a href="https://vital.audio">Vital</a>. This sound will be getting a lot of use from me in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a more general music sense, <a href="https://youtu.be/oKWgLe-jQjc">Adam Neely's video on the subculture of video game music in jazz</a> was a very fun watch, and was just generally quite inspiring in that way that just makes you want to make music.
            </li>
            <li>
              This may not be the most original topic for the last couple months or so, but I had a <i>ton</i> of fun playing <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/134292-myhousewad/">myhouse.wad</a>. As someone who has never had much interest in DOOM or DOOM modding, it was a ton of fun to see all the tricks happening (and the fact that I'd already read <span style="color: #036bfc;">House</span> of Leaves made it a blast to see all the different references).
          </ul>
      <p>
          Hope you enjoy all of this! Until next time!

      The last little while has been back and forth; emotional and emotionless, ecstatic and exhausted, deep feelings and small ones alike swimming out of each other. Feelings are infinite, but antonyms are not, so I'll diverge.<br>
      I guess I've been thinking about why I bought this domain and created this website in the first place - was it to learn skills and put some things I'd been taught to practice? Partially, yes.<br>
      Was it just because I was bored, and this website is that kind of project that always seems to take up exactly as much time as you need it to? Also yes, but only partially.<br>
      My best guess is that I was motivated by a prelapsarian idea of the internet; by the time I could perceive <i>The Internet</i> as a space in and of itself, the blog was already on its way out, and by the time I could access it consistently, it was about as prevalent as it is today.<br>
      Once I was able to put myself on the internet, it could only be through a Platform, the process of self-expression simplified, flattened, and gameified all at once.<br>
      The change was obvious; making this website actually took a fairly surprising amount of research and effort, and making an account on another website is as painless as it can be.<br>
      Beyond just the aesthetics of geocities websites and bare-bones CSS, I suppose I just wanted a piece of that self-expression that existed in the past, when people could represent themselves with websites that were crude, possibly simple, but importantly <i>theirs.</i><br>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
      So, insofar as I carry on that tradition, excuse the clunky CSS and clunkier ramblings you may see here. I'm just trying to live in the past, one blog post at a time.

      It looks like the idea of polishing up the website went well! Learning html and css has always been very dry to me, but I found some good-looking websites to take as examples.<br>
      Namely, <a href="https://sinewave.cyou/index.html">this website</a> that I used as an example to figure out these cool-looking boxes has been extremely helpful.<br>
      Now that I've fixed the music tab, the next item on the agenda is probably to figure out how to get another font onto here, but I'll probably save that for another day.<br>
      But, for now, things have been going well otherwise. I have plenty of creative projects to keep myself occupied (including this website), so I haven't allowed myself to get very bored.

      Well, not too much has really happened since the last time I saw this<br>
      I have a lot more song ideas than I did before and I got some new audio equipment to make them happen, so hopefully that starts resulting in some actual finished products<br>
      Going to be trying to make this website look... just a bit more polished, hopefully. Working without any experience and just referencing off of sites I find that look cool, so hopefully that goes okay<br>

      Work was definitely something - finished everything I had to do by 12:30 and barely anything new came in before I was out at 5<br>
      Finally hit 1000 ELO and terrified to ever play again for fear of it going under again<br>
      Probably going to see the new Avatar film (and hopefully The Whale) soon

      Slept in well this morning - still haven't made my bed as of 10:51pm<br>
      Looking to do a little more with this website, possibly turn it into a blog sort of deal like it was 2005 or smthn<br>
      Had a very important (I think) interview for college, so fairly excited with that, though not sure if I should be looking into scholarships at this point<br>
      Big into chess since I last updated this site, been winning a lot of games recently, <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/crazyjonyjon465" target="_blank">almost to 1000 ELO on chess.com</a>, which I'm quite proud of<br>
      Completely taken me out of video games in general though, it's a little bit all-consuming but generally worth it<br>
      So, I think that's it... stay tuned, if you're out there, I guess
