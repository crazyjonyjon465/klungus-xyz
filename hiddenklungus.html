      It looks like the idea of polishing up the website went well! Learning html and css has always been very dry to me, but I found some good-looking websites to take as examples.<br>
      Namely, <a href="https://sinewave.cyou/index.html">this website</a> that I used as an example to figure out these cool-looking boxes has been extremely helpful.<br>
      Now that I've fixed the music tab, the next item on the agenda is probably to figure out how to get another font onto here, but I'll probably save that for another day.<br>
      But, for now, things have been going well otherwise. I have plenty of creative projects to keep myself occupied (including this website), so I haven't allowed myself to get very bored.

      Well, not too much has really happened since the last time I saw this<br>
      I have a lot more song ideas than I did before and I got some new audio equipment to make them happen, so hopefully that starts resulting in some actual finished products<br>
      Going to be trying to make this website look... just a bit more polished, hopefully. Working without any experience and just referencing off of sites I find that look cool, so hopefully that goes okay<br>

      Work was definitely something - finished everything I had to do by 12:30 and barely anything new came in before I was out at 5<br>
      Finally hit 1000 ELO and terrified to ever play again for fear of it going under again<br>
      Probably going to see the new Avatar film (and hopefully The Whale) soon

      Slept in well this morning - still haven't made my bed as of 10:51pm<br>
      Looking to do a little more with this website, possibly turn it into a blog sort of deal like it was 2005 or smthn<br>
      Had a very important (I think) interview for college, so fairly excited with that, though not sure if I should be looking into scholarships at this point<br>
      Big into chess since I last updated this site, been winning a lot of games recently, <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/crazyjonyjon465" target="_blank">almost to 1000 ELO on chess.com</a>, which I'm quite proud of<br>
      Completely taken me out of video games in general though, it's a little bit all-consuming but generally worth it<br>
      So, I think that's it... stay tuned, if you're out there, I guess
