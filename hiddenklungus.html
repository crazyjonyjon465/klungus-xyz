    <h1>12/9/22</h1>
    <p>
      Slept in well this morning - still haven't made my bed as of 10:51pm<br>
      Looking to do a little more with this website, possibly turn it into a blog sort of deal like it was 2005 or smthn<br>
      Had a very important (I think) interview for college, so fairly excited with that, though not sure if I should be looking into scholarships at this point<br>
      Big into chess since I last updated this site, been winning a lot of games recently, <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/crazyjonyjon465" target="_blank">almost to 1000 ELO on chess.com</a>, which I'm quite proud of<br>
      Completely taken me out of video games in general though, it's a little bit all-consuming but generally worth it<br>
      So, I think that's it... stay tuned, if you're out there, I guess

    <p>Media I've been enjoying:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Glass Houses - Billy Joel</li>
      <li>Knives Out Soundtrack - Nathan Johnson</li>
    </ul>
