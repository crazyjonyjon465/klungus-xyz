      The last little while has been back and forth; emotional and emotionless, ecstatic and exhausted, deep feelings and small ones alike swimming out of each other. Feelings are infinite, but antonyms are not, so I'll diverge.<br>
      I guess I've been thinking about why I bought this domain and created this website in the first place - was it to learn skills and put some things I'd been taught to practice? Partially, yes.<br>
      Was it just because I was bored, and this website is that kind of project that always seems to take up exactly as much time as you need it to? Also yes, but only partially.<br>
      My best guess is that I was motivated by a prelapsarian idea of the internet; by the time I could perceive <i>The Internet</i> as a space in and of itself, the blog was already on its way out, and by the time I could access it consistently, it was about as prevalent as it is today.<br>
      Once I was able to put myself on the internet, it could only be through a Platform, the process of self-expression simplified, flattened, and gameified all at once.<br>
      The change was obvious; making this website actually took a fairly surprising amount of research and effort, and making an account on another website is as painless as it can be.<br>
      Beyond just the aesthetics of geocities websites and bare-bones CSS, I suppose I just wanted a piece of that self-expression that existed in the past, when people could represent themselves with websites that were crude, possibly simple, but importantly <i>theirs.</i><br>
      </p>

      So, insofar as I carry on that tradition, excuse the clunky CSS and clunkier ramblings you may see here. I'm just trying to live in the past, one blog post at a time.

      It looks like the idea of polishing up the website went well! Learning html and css has always been very dry to me, but I found some good-looking websites to take as examples.<br>
      Namely, <a href="https://sinewave.cyou/index.html">this website</a> that I used as an example to figure out these cool-looking boxes has been extremely helpful.<br>
      Now that I've fixed the music tab, the next item on the agenda is probably to figure out how to get another font onto here, but I'll probably save that for another day.<br>
      But, for now, things have been going well otherwise. I have plenty of creative projects to keep myself occupied (including this website), so I haven't allowed myself to get very bored.

      Well, not too much has really happened since the last time I saw this<br>
      I have a lot more song ideas than I did before and I got some new audio equipment to make them happen, so hopefully that starts resulting in some actual finished products<br>
      Going to be trying to make this website look... just a bit more polished, hopefully. Working without any experience and just referencing off of sites I find that look cool, so hopefully that goes okay<br>

      Work was definitely something - finished everything I had to do by 12:30 and barely anything new came in before I was out at 5<br>
      Finally hit 1000 ELO and terrified to ever play again for fear of it going under again<br>
      Probably going to see the new Avatar film (and hopefully The Whale) soon

      Slept in well this morning - still haven't made my bed as of 10:51pm<br>
      Looking to do a little more with this website, possibly turn it into a blog sort of deal like it was 2005 or smthn<br>
      Had a very important (I think) interview for college, so fairly excited with that, though not sure if I should be looking into scholarships at this point<br>
      Big into chess since I last updated this site, been winning a lot of games recently, <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/crazyjonyjon465" target="_blank">almost to 1000 ELO on chess.com</a>, which I'm quite proud of<br>
      Completely taken me out of video games in general though, it's a little bit all-consuming but generally worth it<br>
      So, I think that's it... stay tuned, if you're out there, I guess
