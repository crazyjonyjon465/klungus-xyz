        Welcome to what I think will be the start of my chess blog
        <br>
        I suppose this will probably be a mix of theory I've been looking into as well as some of my own games (probably just the good ones, public humiliation is not really my thing).
        <br>
        Open up the folder below to see the game! (Trying to cut down on how long this page will eventually be)

            This blitz game was played on chess.com, myself playing with the white pieces.
            <br><br>
            After 1. d4 d6, I decided to take it into territory I know slightly well after 2. e4, transposing into a Pirc Defense, which was my main defense against 1.e4 with black for a few months.
            <br>
            2... g6 3. Nf3 b6 4. Be2 c5?? the engine rates it as about +2 if only I play 5. dxc5, where 5... dxc5 6. Qxd8+ Kxd8 gives myself an obvious advantage, and 5... bxc5 6. Qd5! traps a rook - a no-brainer move if there ever was one.
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move5.png" alt="5. dxc5 clearly wins for white">
            <br>
            <br>
            But, of course, I have no brain, and 5. d5 was played instead - still winning, but not as decisive an advantage. After the expected 5... Nf6 6. Nc3 Bg7, the plan to trade off the dark-squared bishop commences after 7. Be3 O-O 8. Qd2 Ng4 looking to trade knight for bishop - at this point, I honestly didn't mind, since black is so clearly underdeveloped.
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move8.png" alt="Engine gives this position +1.37">
            <br>
            <br>
            9. O-O-O looks sensible enough, but the engine rates it as an error, giving an advantage for black - I suspect it may have something to do with the amount of space black has on the queenside, but in the moment I didn't see much in the cards as an immediate 9... b5 drops a pawn, though the engine considers it the second-best move, so what do I know?
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move8arrows.png" alt="Engine gives this a -0.95">
            <br>
            <br>
            Of course, this evaluation rapidly fades away after 9... e5, where I reject the teachings of Anarchy Chess and refuse to take en passant with 10. h3 Nxe3 11. Qxe3, where I considered myself to be better (despite the engine's cries of "Draw!, Draw!")
            <br>
            11... Nd7 12. g4 h6 13. h4 Nf6 trying to make a kingside attack, but the g-pawn is attacked twice and defended by none, threatening to win it and extinguish the attack.
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move13.png" alt="Engine takes a smoke break on this one, calling it at 0.00">
            <br>
            <br>
            Only one move works here, that being 14. Nh2!
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move14.png" alt="Still zeroes from the engine at this point">
            <br>
            Similar to how my opponent created a double-attack, I created a double-defense, with the f-pawn now free to move forward to defend its neighbor if that becomes necessary.
            <br>
            <br>
            My opponent seemed to believe that there were no more prospects for them on the kingside, so the brazen 14... a5? was played, immediately running into 15. g5, the entire point of my 13th move!
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move15.png" alt="The knight's gotta go somewhere! +2.3 from the engine">
            <br>
            in fact, the best move in the previous position was for black to reatreat the knight to either e8 or h7 in anticipation of g5.
            <br>
            <br>
            15... Nh5 was the wrong place for the knight to go, as it's left incredibly vulnerable with the easily pinned defender of the pawn on g6, an immediate 16. gxh6 Bh8 showing the weakness of black's position - despite having the glorious bishop on the long diagonal, it's been shoved into the corner!
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move16.png" alt="White has a +3.5 advantage according to stockfish">
            <br>
            <br>
            17. Bxh5 gxh5 instantly rips open the black king's defenses, where the pieces begin their harrassment.
            <br>
            18. Rdg1+ Kh7 and I've run out of checks, but the king is cut off along the open file - additionally, the h4 pawn is completely undefended from black's queen
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move18.png" alt="Still crushing for white - +3.8 from the engine">
            <br>
            <br>
            Not satisfied with revealing the defense of just one pawn, this knight does it again with 19. Nf3, the best move, with the now-defended pawn on h4 serving the vital purpose of holding down the g5 square, where many of my pieces would like to get to for a big attack.
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move19.png" alt="The plan has been set into motion, and the plan of attack has been set">
            <br>
            <br>
            19... Rg8? 20. Rxg8 as played is suboptimal, but still winning - instead 20. Ng5+ would have forced black to sacrifice an exchange, as running the king forces them to part ways with their queen after either 20... Kg6 21. Ne6+ or immediately lose after 20... Kxh6 21. Nxf7+ Kh7 22. Qh6#
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move20.png" alt="Trading rooks as I did is winning, but Ng5+ is complete devastation!">
            <br>
            <br>
            20... Qxg8 21. Ng5+ One move too late! Alas, this is still completely winning, as after 21... Kg6 22. Rg1, the rook's alignment with the queen along the sensitive g-file becomes too much for the position to bear.
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move22.png" alt="The rook and knight are ready to wreak havoc, no queen required... yet!">
            <br>
            <br>
            Not a single line can preserve both black's king and queen, but my opponent tries with 22... Kf6?, trying to give the queen an opportunity to get out of the way. However, this falls into mate in 9 moves no matter what happens according to the engine after 23. Nh7+!!
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move23.png" alt="The final tactical flourish to complete the attack">
            <br>
            <br>
            The attack on the queen and king at the same time would usually be devastating enough on its own, but the queen can take the knight, as my opponent did with 23... Qxh7?, but, the deflection of the queen from the all-important g5 square leads to black's doom, as 24. Qg5# finishes the game with the help of the central pawns.
