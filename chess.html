        Hello again, back here for another entry into this... thing.
        <br><br>
        This here was a rapid game I played a couple weeks ago that prompted me to restudy my opening.
        <br><br>
        If I were to give this study a name, I would probably call it "Why You Should Study Endgames"
      </p>

            Alright, once again, myself playing with the white pieces here.
            <br><br>
            I started off with my first and most common opening, the Italian Game, with 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move3.png">
            <br><br>
            My opponent responded with what is apparently called the Paris Defense with 3...d6, and this is what actually got me to re-study my opening.
            <br>
            I've studied for 3...Bc5 and 3...Nf6, but for some reason, this decent move slipped under my radar.
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move3.1.png">
            <br><br>
            4. c3 follows through with the usual Italian plan of playing for d4, and 4... Bg4 follows up the pawn push with developing the light-squared bishop.
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move4.png">
            <br><br>
            At this point, I just castled, 5. O-O. What I should have done was played 5. Qb3!, winning a pawn at the very least with the double attack on b7 and f7, Opera Game-style.
            <br>
            The lines I looked at after the game were: <br>
            5... Na5 6. Bxf7 Ke7 7. Qa4 Kxf7 8. Qxa5 being better for white, as black can no longer castle. <br>
            5... Qd7 6. Qxb7 Rb8 7. Qa6 Bxf3 8. gxf3 with the damaged structure on the kingside being not terrible for white, as you can still castle queenside. <br>
            Regardless, what happened in the game after I castled followed 5... Qd7 6. d4 O-O-O?! where I absolutely should have just played 7. d5! and forced the knight to move, but instead I played 7. Nbd2?, the queen losing contact of d4 and dropping the all-important central pawn.<br>
            My guess as to why I did this was that I was just <i>that</i> worried about getting doubled f-pawns that I felt the need to overprotect the knight before I could move my queen, but just playing 7. d5 would have allowed me to play Nbd2 without losing anything.<br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move7.png">
            <br><br>
            After 7... exd4 is when I cross into "losing position territory", with 8. Nb3!? dxc3 9. bxc3 giving me a horrid queenside structure.<br>
            9... Ne5 then started a flurry of exchanges with 10. Nxe5 dxe5 11. Qxd7+ Rxd7.<br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move11.png">
            <br><br>
            12. h3 Bh5 13. Be3 Nf6 and my position goes from bad to worse after 14. Nc5? Bxc5 15. Bxc5 Kb8? with my opponent luckily not playing the devastating 15... Nxe4<br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move15.png">
            <br><br>
            16. Rfe1 Rd2 17. Rab1 b6 18. Be3 Rc2 19. g4 Bg6 20. Bb3 Rxc3 21. f3 Rd8 22. h4 h5 23. g5 Ne8 24. Bd5 c5? with my opponent not finding 24... Rxd5! as 25. exd5 Bxb1 and the rook unable to take due to its duty to defend the bishop.<br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move24.png">
            <br><br>
            25. a4 Nc7 26. Ba2 f6 27. a5 b5 28. Bf2 fxg5 29. Rec1 Rxf3 30. Rxc5 a6 31. Kg2??, with the engine giving some crazy nonsense with 31. Rxc7 Rxf2 32. Rxg7 Rxa2 33. Rxg6 where even then white is down 2 pawns and the resulting rook endgame is losing.<br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move31.png">
            <br><br>
            31. Bxe4 Rxe5 32. Rxf2+? is still winning, but 32. Rd2 was crushing<br>
            32... Kxf2 33. Bxb1 34. Bxb1 Rd5 35. Rxd5 Nxd5 36. hxg5 and the endgame has finally simplified - bishop and two pawns versus knight and four pawns. In serious play, black should win this game every time, but I saw no reason not to fight on.<br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move36.png">
            <br><br>
            36... Kc7 37. Kg3 b4 38. Kh4 b3 39. Kxh5 and even at this point, with my king having become very active, 39... Ne7 still holds onto the game, as my king would not be able to get to the pawn on g8 in time.<br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move39.png">
            <br><br>
            But, my opponent's understanding of the endgame seemed to just boil down to "push the pawn", so 39... b2?? is played, and the engine evaluates this as a dead draw due to the move 40. Kg6!, and the king gets in to take the pawn on g8 - after both pawns promote, the pieces are forced to sacrifice themselves for the queens, with the resulting king and pawn endgame being drawn.<br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move40.png">
            <br><br>
            After 40... Nc3 41. Bd3, just promoting with 41... b1=Q 42. Bxb1 Nxg1 43. Kxg7 Nc3 44. g6 Nd5 45. Kf7 Kd7 46. g7 Ne7 and the previously mentioned draw is reached<br>
            However, 41... Kd6 was played, and after 42. Kxg7 Ke7 43. g6, black needs to bring the knight back to help prevent the promotion of white's g-pawn, however, the critical error occurs instead with 43... b1=Q??<br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move43.png">
            <br><br>
            44. Bxb1 Nxb1 puts the knight too far away to assist the king in preventing white from promoting, and after 45. Kh8, my opponent seemed to realize this, and resigned.<br>
            <img src="images\chess\4-4-23\move45.png">
            <br><br>
            Let this be a strong lesson to the aspiring player - never resign even when an endgame position looks hopeless, get your king active in the endgame, and play on until the end.

        Welcome to what I think will be the start of my chess blog
        <br><br>
        I suppose this will probably be a mix of theory I've been looking into as well as some of my own games (probably just the good ones, public humiliation is not really my thing).
        <br><br>
        Open up the folder below to see the game! (Trying to cut down on how long this page will eventually be)

            This blitz game was played on chess.com, myself playing with the white pieces.
            <br><br>
            After 1. d4 d6, I decided to take it into territory I know slightly well after 2. e4, transposing into a Pirc Defense, which was my main defense against 1.e4 with black for a few months.
            <br>
            2... g6 3. Nf3 b6 4. Be2 c5?? the engine rates it as about +2 if only I play 5. dxc5, where 5... dxc5 6. Qxd8+ Kxd8 gives myself an obvious advantage, and 5... bxc5 6. Qd5! traps a rook - a no-brainer move if there ever was one.
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move5.png" alt="5. dxc5 clearly wins for white">
            <br>
            <br>
            But, of course, I have no brain, and 5. d5 was played instead - still winning, but not as decisive an advantage. After the expected 5... Nf6 6. Nc3 Bg7, the plan to trade off the dark-squared bishop commences after 7. Be3 O-O 8. Qd2 Ng4 looking to trade knight for bishop - at this point, I honestly didn't mind, since black is so clearly underdeveloped.
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move8.png" alt="Engine gives this position +1.37">
            <br>
            <br>
            9. O-O-O looks sensible enough, but the engine rates it as an error, giving an advantage for black - I suspect it may have something to do with the amount of space black has on the queenside, but in the moment I didn't see much in the cards as an immediate 9... b5 drops a pawn, though the engine considers it the second-best move, so what do I know?
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move8arrows.png" alt="Engine gives this a -0.95">
            <br>
            <br>
            Of course, this evaluation rapidly fades away after 9... e5, where I reject the teachings of Anarchy Chess and refuse to take en passant with 10. h3 Nxe3 11. Qxe3, where I considered myself to be better (despite the engine's cries of "Draw!, Draw!")
            <br>
            11... Nd7 12. g4 h6 13. h4 Nf6 trying to make a kingside attack, but the g-pawn is attacked twice and defended by none, threatening to win it and extinguish the attack.
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move13.png" alt="Engine takes a smoke break on this one, calling it at 0.00">
            <br>
            <br>
            Only one move works here, that being 14. Nh2!
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move14.png" alt="Still zeroes from the engine at this point">
            <br>
            Similar to how my opponent created a double-attack, I created a double-defense, with the f-pawn now free to move forward to defend its neighbor if that becomes necessary.
            <br>
            <br>
            My opponent seemed to believe that there were no more prospects for them on the kingside, so the brazen 14... a5? was played, immediately running into 15. g5, the entire point of my 13th move!
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move15.png" alt="The knight's gotta go somewhere! +2.3 from the engine">
            <br>
            in fact, the best move in the previous position was for black to reatreat the knight to either e8 or h7 in anticipation of g5.
            <br>
            <br>
            15... Nh5 was the wrong place for the knight to go, as it's left incredibly vulnerable with the easily pinned defender of the pawn on g6, an immediate 16. gxh6 Bh8 showing the weakness of black's position - despite having the glorious bishop on the long diagonal, it's been shoved into the corner!
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move16.png" alt="White has a +3.5 advantage according to stockfish">
            <br>
            <br>
            17. Bxh5 gxh5 instantly rips open the black king's defenses, where the pieces begin their harrassment.
            <br>
            18. Rdg1+ Kh7 and I've run out of checks, but the king is cut off along the open file - additionally, the h4 pawn is completely undefended from black's queen
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move18.png" alt="Still crushing for white - +3.8 from the engine">
            <br>
            <br>
            Not satisfied with revealing the defense of just one pawn, this knight does it again with 19. Nf3, the best move, with the now-defended pawn on h4 serving the vital purpose of holding down the g5 square, where many of my pieces would like to get to for a big attack.
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move19.png" alt="The plan has been set into motion, and the plan of attack has been set">
            <br>
            <br>
            19... Rg8? 20. Rxg8 as played is suboptimal, but still winning - instead 20. Ng5+ would have forced black to sacrifice an exchange, as running the king forces them to part ways with their queen after either 20... Kg6 21. Ne6+ or immediately lose after 20... Kxh6 21. Nxf7+ Kh7 22. Qh6#
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move20.png" alt="Trading rooks as I did is winning, but Ng5+ is complete devastation!">
            <br>
            <br>
            20... Qxg8 21. Ng5+ One move too late! Alas, this is still completely winning, as after 21... Kg6 22. Rg1, the rook's alignment with the queen along the sensitive g-file becomes too much for the position to bear.
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move22.png" alt="The rook and knight are ready to wreak havoc, no queen required... yet!">
            <br>
            <br>
            Not a single line can preserve both black's king and queen, but my opponent tries with 22... Kf6?, trying to give the queen an opportunity to get out of the way. However, this falls into mate in 9 moves no matter what happens according to the engine after 23. Nh7+!!
            <br>
            <img src="images\chess\3-15-23\move23.png" alt="The final tactical flourish to complete the attack">
            <br>
            <br>
            The attack on the queen and king at the same time would usually be devastating enough on its own, but the queen can take the knight, as my opponent did with 23... Qxh7?, but, the deflection of the queen from the all-important g5 square leads to black's doom, as 24. Qg5# finishes the game with the help of the central pawns.
